		details: "Software developers have to be able to change business conversations into viable applications. In the process code is written and the ideas formed in the conversations are translated into the codebase. As the application progresses those business ideas (or business specifications) are placed throughout the codebase as developers work to create their final product. During this process what is lost is the cohesive business conversation that originally took place. In its place are a bunch of fragments representing single ideas from those conversations. Those ideas are so fragmented that they cannot be used to reconstruct the original conversation. Its common to hear developers say \"the business doesn't know how it does business\". But after having all of these conversations to help solve that problem those same developers are not making use of the application\'s codebase as a tool to clearly and centrally answer the question of what does the business really do. In this session we will discuss the fundamental principles of Domain Driven Design and explore how it can help to provide well encapsulated code, clear documentation of what the business does and a common ligua franca for communication with the business whenever the need arises.",
